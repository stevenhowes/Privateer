# Privateer

Back in 2019 I was playing with a graphics engine called irrlicht (and the associated sound system called irrklang). This was a quick play around with that to immitate the flying system from Privateer 2: The Darkening.

Many of the assets for the game have been placed in public domain and have been used. All other models/textures are from free online asset stores. It was so long ago I'm not sure I can fairly credit, but if anything here is yours then let me know and I'll credit (or remove) as required.

- \+ = increase speed
- \- = decrease speed
- \[ = minimum speed
- \] = maximum speed
- tab = afterburner

Flight direction is controlled with the mouse. It's every bit as un-controllable as the original game at first - look at the arrows around the crosshairs to get a feel if you're struggling. It's a game much more suited to a joystick
